//!Task calculates the statistical errors of all histograms of the selected files based on the subsample method.
//!The input file are selected based on a name template. All files read are assumed to have the same histogram structure (named objects).
//!They are read sequentially and added into a new histogram collection. The summed collection is then used to computed rms deviates
//!which are then set as errors in the histograms saved on output. The name of the output file is generated based on the template name
//!and a selected appendString name. This class should NOT be run as a subtask of a more complex task in its current form.
