//!
//! This class implements a basic analyzer of the multiplicity, energy, net charge, net strangeness, and net baryon number of the particles composing an event.
//! A global analyzer task can be used to determine the multiplcity (or other characteristics) of an event and set the event record with these values. The values
//! then become available to other tasks, and the event filters they operate,  to decide whether the analysis of an event should be carried out. The task can be
//! operated with several event filters and it is then possible to determine the distribution of multiplicity, energy, net charge, etc, based on specific event filters
//! (e.g., multiplicity or collision centrality classes). The task can  be operated with one or more particle filters. It is then possible to determine the multiplicity of
//! specific types of particles or the yield in specific pseudorapidity, transverse momentum ranges (etc).  When several event filters are used, only the first (index zero)
//! is used to set the event property record of an event. Note that the HistogramsCreate parameter must be set to YES (true) to fill histograms of this class.
//! This means that an instance of this class can be used to analyze the multiplicity (energy, etc) of events with or without filling corresponding histograms. It is
//! then possible to set the event property record only (base on event filter index 0), fill histograms only, or both set the record and fill histograms.
