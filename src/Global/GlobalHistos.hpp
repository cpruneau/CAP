//! HistogramGroup of "global" observables.
//!
//! Observables are computed in the acceptance defined by
//! particle filters for each of the selected event filters. The particle filters can be set to select narrow
//! or broad ranges of kinematic variables as well as species
//! of particles.
//!
//! n:  number of selected particles in an  event
//! e:  total energy of the selected particles in an event
//! q:  total (net) electric charge of the selected particles in an event
//! b:  total (net) baryon charge of the selected particles in an event
//!
//! The fill method of this class must be called at most once per event
//! otherwise weird multiple counting will happen..

  //! By default, only histograms of single particle quantities are filled. These include the number of particles (multiplicity), the pt sum,
  //! the total energy, the net charge, the net strangeness, and the net baryon number. Scatter plot histograms of observable correlations
  //! are also filled including for instance ptSum vs multiplicity, total E vs multiplicity, net charge vs multiplicity, and so on. An eventwise  pt average
  //! histogram is also filled (event by event), for all event and particle filters, when the selected mulitplicity in non zero.
  //!
  //! If the bool variable fillCorrelationHistos is set to true, cross-species histograms are also filled including for instance the multiplicity selected by
  //! particle filter k1 and the multiplicity selected by filter k2.
