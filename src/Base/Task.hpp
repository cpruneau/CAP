//!The correlation analysis package (CAP) consists of several modules and classes designed for use within the [root] data analysis framework.
//!Depending on your needs, it may be sufficient to have a binary installation of "root", but if you require the generation of collision data with, e.g.,  the [PYTHIA] model (PYTHIA8),
//!you may need to install and build root from source. Evidently, to use such generators as Pythia8, you will additionally have to download, install, and build PYTHIA8 on your own
//!machine.
//!CAP is orgainzed into several modules that you may not readily need in your analysis. The package thus use CMake to build and maintain the libraries associated with
//!each module. Instructions to configure and compile the basic CAP package are provided in sec. XXXXX. You may optionally download the DOXYGEN documentation framework
//!if you plan to add and document modules and packages.

//!\subsection installation Installation/Configuration
//!
//!In its current version, CAP does include or provide for the building of binary executables (although it is easy to setup if you are proficient with CMAKE).
//!Its uses thus relies entirely on a generic version of root and root loads of relevant CAP (root compatible) libraries.
//!The building, compilation,  and use of the CAP package is determined by few environment varibles which can be efficiently setup and assigned by
//!sourcing the SETUP_CAP configuration file.
//!
//!\verbatim
//!cd SOMEPATH/CAP;
//!source Setup_CAP
//!\endverbatim
//!
//!Prior to sourcing this setup file, however, you must edit the file to choose appropriate valeues  to the following lines that assigne environment variables
//!\verbatim
//!export ROOT_SELECTED_VERSION="/Users/YourName/rootdirectory/"
//!export CAP_LARGE_DATA="/Volumes/SomeHardDiskOfYourChoice/CAP-DATA/"
//!\endverbatim
//!
//!The Setup_CAP script will assign default values for the location in binary and library files produced when build the libraries. You can evidently modify these to your liking.

//! <H1>Task</h1>
//!
//! The Task class is a base class used to define data analysis tasks and provide some of the basic resources required for the generation and analysis of data.
//!
//! The task base class provides the basic tools and functionality typically required for the analysis of simulation data as well as "real" data. This base class defines
//! basic methods needed for the analysis of data and the management of files, histograms, etc. Tasks are typically data centric and require access to one or more event
//! streams. Event streams used for i/o by a particular tasks are identified with boolean flags in the task configuration used by a speficific task instance. While most tasks
//! only required one stream (turned on with the useStream0 flag), it is also possible to use as many as 10 streams. This can be of interest, for instance, for tasks that
//! convert data or modify data (e.g., class ParticlePerformanceSimulator).
//!
//! <H2>Task/subtask(s)</H2>
//!
//! The Task class is defined to be recursive, i.e., a task can have one or many subTasks. An example of class having one or many subTasks is the TaskIterator class designed
//! control the analysis of data sets consisting of large numbers of events and requiring calls to different types of classes to carry out several types of operations. Typically
//! an analysis job using the TaskIterator class would use a task to generate or read data from file (e.g., WacPythia/PythiaEventGenerator), and one or more tasks to fill
//! histograms. To add a sub-task to a task, use the addSubTask method.
//!
//! The task class provides several methods (functions) used to carry out specific tasks, such as task initialization,, task execution,
//! task finilization, and basic operations related to histograms such as histogram creation, histogram scaling at the end of analysis (to carry normalization e.g.,
//! per event analyzed, histgram saving to file, calculations of 'derived' histograms, etc. Given a task can have one or many subTasks, a mechanism is required to
//! enable a task to automatically invoke its subTasks. Generic methods thus have two levels of invocation. For instance, to carry out the action for which a specific subclass
//! is designed, call its "execute()" method. However, if the class instance has subTasks and you wish to call the class "execute" as well as the execute methods
//! of all its subTasks, use the "executeSubTasks()" method. Similarly, methods to clear, reset, initialize, finalize tasks and their subTasks shall be called "clearSubTasks()",
//! "resetSubTasks()", etc,  in general "xxxxxTasks()".  Note, that the operation "xxxxx" is first called for the parent and next invoked for the subTasks. Actually, since
//! tasks can have subTasks recursively, it is this the "xxxxxTasks()" operation which is called on the subTasks. This method in turn calls the "xxxxxx()" on the subtask
//! and next all of its subTasks, if any, recursively.
//!
//! <H2>Operations/Methods</H2>
//!
//! Operations defined by the base class are as follows:
//! <ol>
//! <li>initialize(): A method called to initialize a task instance. In principle, one could think of initializing a task within its constructor. Within the WAC framework, however,
//! the configuration of a task is kept separate from the task itself and one can actually change the configuration of task after it has been instantiated. Since calling
//! the constructor anew is evidently not possible, the initialize() method provides the ability to actually carry out the initialization once the configuration has been
//! set, even though changes may be done after the task is instantiated. Note, however, there is not provision to automatically reinitialize a task if its configuration
//! is changed after initialization. This can be done "manually" however by calling the clear() or reset() methods of the class as appropriate.
//!
//! <li>execute(): A method called to carry out or execute the task at hand. The present version of the code does not implement a state engine that keeps track
//! of whether or not a task has been initialized or not. This falls under the responsibility of the user. Note that the TaskIterator class handles all operations sequentially
//! and gracefully thereby insuring operations are carried in "the proper order". Additionally note that if an exception or error occurs during the initialization, execution,
//! or any other stage of a task, a PostTaskStatus call is placed to identify the abnormal condition.
//!
//! <li>finalize(): A method called to finalize a task instance. The finalize() method implemented in the base class  automatically calls various functions to scale
//!histograms (per event scaling), to compute derived histogram (as needed), and save histograms to a root file.
//!
//! <li>reset():  A method called to rest the task so it can be execute anew.
//! <li>clear():  A method called to clear the task -- effectively putting the task into an "uninitialized" state.
//! <li>savePartial(): A method called to save the histogram objects handled  this task to an indexed file. The output path and name of the file are stipulated
//!by the configuration class. Partial saves, as opposed on a single "final" save, of the histogram are carried out automatically if the "partialSave" boolean
//!flag is set in the class configuration. The frequency of the partial saves is defined by the TaskIterator configuration class. The file name under which histograms are
//!saved is specified by a base file name stated in the class configuration and an partial save index automatically incremented after each partial save.
//!
//! <li>subsampleAnalysis(): A method called to carry a subsample analysis of the statistical uncertainties of all the histograms held by an instance of this class. This
//!methods uses the base name + partial index to iteratively open all the files to be included in the computation of the statistical uncertainties. Note that while root automatically
//!computes statistical errors or simple histograms, one cannot, typically, on regular error propagation techniques to compute the statistical uncertainties of complex
//!observables such as two, three, or more particle correlators. The subsample analysis technique thus provides a reasonable subtitute for this purpose. See XXXXX.
//! <li>printConfiguration(): A method to print  the configuration of  a task instance. While this method usually calls the printConfiguration() method of the configuration
//! class, it may be possible to print additional information into the output stream.
//! </ol>
//!
//! <H2>Analysis control </H2>
//! Data generation and analysis tasks rely on one or several event streams which present a task with one or several instances of the Event class (or possibly a subclass).
//! Tasks of interest typically involve the generation, transformation, or use of the event stream(s) to fill histograms. Whether feeding or retrieving events into an
//! event stream, it is useful to abstract the control of the type of events and particles produces or accepts based on generic criteria or filters. For filling histograms
//! of single particle observables or correlation observables should not depend explicitly on the type of events being read or the particles these events contain. Indeed,
//! histogram filling operations usually do not depend on details and can thus be considered "abstract" histogram filling tasks. Evidently, a particular analysis be
//! be focused on ultra peripheral or most central heavy-ion collisions or anything in between. It may also be of interest to specifically choose the type of
//! particles or what kinematic ranges are of interest. Instead of hard coding such choices, the WAC framework includes notions of event and particle filters, encapsulated
//! into the EventFilter and ParticleFilter classes, respectively. There is additionally a ParticlePairFilter class. These filter classes are designed to be very generic and
//! flexible but use a unique strategy and method to decide whether an event or a particle (or a pair of particles) should be accepted and thus used/readin/output
//! by a task. Deciding whether an event or a particle is acceptable, one simply callss the accept method of the filter:
//!
//! <pre>myEventFilter->accept(anEvent);</pre>
//!
//! or
//!
//! <pre>myParticleFilter->accept(aParticle);</pre>
//!
//! The WAC framework includes the classes EventFilter and ParticleFilter that both instrument this "accept" method. These two classes are designed to handle
//! a wide variety of conditions and types of analysis. Please refer to the documentation of these two classes for more information.
//!
//!In general, in a particular data analysis, it may be desirable to  classify the events to be analyzed in several different (partially overlapping or fully) distinct
//!categories. This is readily accomplished by instantiating several event filters as input to a task. Input event filters to a task can be accomplished at
//!Task construction time by submitting a vector of event filter or by adding filters one by one to the task using the addEventFilter method.
//!
//!Similarly, it may also be of interest to repeat the same exact type of analysis of several different particle types. This can be accomplished by instantiating several
//!particle filters and inputing them into a task. As for event filters, this can be accomplished at construction time or via the use of the addParticleFilter method.
//!
//!Once constructed and initialized with sets of event and particle filters, most task classes currently defined in the WAC framework will automatically test each
//!event and each particle considered against the several filters they own and the analysis will then be automatically repeated on types of events and for particles
//!of interest. This feature is currently implemented in the ParticleAnalyzer, ParticlePairAnalyze, NuDynAnalyzer, etc, tasks.
//!
//!Given root expects instantiated histograms to be distinct by name or put in different folders, the EventFilter and ParticleFilter classes feature filter name
//! generators that can be (and in fact used by several tasks) to speficify the name of histigrams. Typically, histogram names are build according to the following
//! pattern:
//!
//! <pre>Job Name + Task Name + Event Filter Name + Particle Filter Name + Observable Name</pre>
